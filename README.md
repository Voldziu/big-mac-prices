### big-mac-prices
Big Mac price comparison between Poland and the United States. Visualized with a double-valued lineplot.

I have found a dataset of Big Mac prices across different countries on kaggle.com and became inspired to chart this. Polish price of the burger was converted to dollars using a date-accurate exchange rate from Stooq.com.

Made with: Python Seaborn & Matplotlib Modules
